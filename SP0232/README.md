## About StudyPods v2.0

Study pods is an initiative taken by DSC MBM to promote peer-to-peer learning among the students with a notion that says “Learn Together, Build Together”.The program is designed to offer participants a good exposure of technology and the technical world. It is an approx one month-long program that connects like-minded participants interested in a particular domain to come together, learn together and then build together. StudyPod mentors assist participants with the roadmap, resources, take weekly updates and solve doubts which cannot be solved by the team members. At the end of the program each StudyPod needs to submit a project or a propsal for a paper that showcases their learnings during the program.

### Prediction
We have taken data set from Kaggle To predict whether customer will purchase given travel package or not.
"Trips & Travel.Com" company wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base. There are 5 types of packages the company is offering - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, King.  Therefore, We pitch a package to customer and predict whether they would purchase it or not. 
Looking at the data of the last year, we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages. However, the marketing cost was quite high because customers were contacted at random without looking at the available information. 
For this ,customer care of company contacted to customer and pitch a travel package & get feedbacks whether they like the products or they would purchase the products according to their background condition i.e age , monthly income, marital status ,desination etc or according to their requirements.
